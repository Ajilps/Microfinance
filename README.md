# üè¶ MicroFinance Web Application Documentation

**Architecture:** MERN Stack + Docker + TypeScript + Microservices

**Methodology:** Agile SCRUM

**Author:** Ajil PS (Full Stack Developer ‚Äì MERN)

**Version:** 1.0.0

---

## üìò 1. Project Overview

### üéØ Objective

The **MicroFinance Web Application** is a modular, containerized financial management system where:

- **Users** can create accounts, deposit money, and apply for loans based on their savings balance.
- **Admins** can manage users, approve loans, edit payment records, and monitor transactions.

The system is built for **scalability and extensibility**, following the **microservice architecture** using **MERN + TypeScript** and **Docker**.

Future modules (e.g. Notifications, Analytics, Payment Gateways) can be seamlessly added as independent services.

## üß© 2. System Architecture

### üîπ Technology Stack

| Layer                | Technology                     | Description                                     |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Frontend**         | React + TypeScript             | User/Admin UI with component-based architecture |
| **Backend**          | Node.js + Express + TypeScript | REST APIs divided into microservices            |
| **Database**         | MongoDB                        | NoSQL data store (one per service)              |
| **Containerization** | Docker + Docker Compose        | For consistent, isolated environments           |
| **API Gateway**      | Nginx                          | Reverse proxy routing between microservices     |
| **Auth**             | JWT + bcrypt                   | Secure authentication and authorization         |
| **Version Control**  | Git + GitHub                   | Source control and CI/CD integration            |
| **Workflow**         | Agile SCRUM                    | Iterative, sprint-based development             |

## üèóÔ∏è 3. Microservice Architecture Design

The application is split into **independent microservices**, each running in its own Docker container.

### üì¶ Core Services

| Service              | Description                                                                       | Port   | Database      |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------ | ------------- |
| **User Service**     | Handles registration, authentication, and user profile data.                      | `5001` | `users-db`    |
| **Account Service**  | Manages deposits, withdrawals, and balances.                                      | `5002` | `accounts-db` |
| **Loan Service**     | Calculates loan eligibility, processes loan applications, and tracks repayments.  | `5003` | `loans-db`    |
| **Admin Service**    | Enables admins to manage users, update loan/payment records, and view dashboards. | `5004` | `admin-db`    |
| **API Gateway**      | Routes requests from the frontend to the correct microservice.                    | `80`   | ‚Äî             |
| **Frontend (React)** | Web interface for users and admins.                                               | `3000` | ‚Äî             |

```

**Communication:**

- Services communicate using **REST (HTTP)** for simplicity.
- In future, **Message Queues (e.g. RabbitMQ)** can be introduced for async communication (e.g. when processing loan approvals).

## üß© 6. Service Responsibilities

### üë§ **User Service**

- Register & authenticate users (JWT)
- Update user profiles
- Manage user roles (user/admin)
- Handle password encryption with `bcrypt`

---

### üí∞ **Account Service**

- Create and manage user savings accounts
- Deposit / withdraw money
- Maintain transaction history
- Calculate current balance

---

### üí≥ **Loan Service**

- Check user loan eligibility (based on savings)
- Create new loan applications
- Track repayments
- Handle interest calculation

---

### üßë‚Äçüíº **Admin Service**

- Manage all users and accounts
- Approve or reject loans
- Edit or update payments
- Generate basic reports

---

## üíª 7. Technology Details (TypeScript + Express)

Example `server.ts` for Account Service:

```tsx
import express from "express";
import dotenv from "dotenv";
import mongoose from "mongoose";

dotenv.config();
const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

app.get("/api/account/health", (req, res) => res.send("Account Service OK"));

mongoose
  .connect(process.env.MONGO_URI!)
  .then(() => console.log("Mongo Connected"))
  .catch((err) => console.log(err));

app.listen(5002, () => console.log("Account Service on 5002"));
```

---

## üîê 8. Authentication & Authorization Flow

1. User registers through **User Service** ‚Üí gets JWT token.
2. JWT token stored in localStorage (frontend) and attached to all requests.
3. Middleware in each microservice validates JWT using a shared `JWT_SECRET`.
4. Admin routes are protected via role-based middleware.
